ORIGINAL PROJECT PROMPT
========================

Using https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl12-core/, create a comprehensive SHACL ontology for converting meeting transcriptions into RDF summaries. 

This would need to handle:
- Determining speakers (use emails as a primary identifier)
- When a comment is made
- Where a meeting occurs (assume an online address tied into a telepresence account such as Teams or Google Meet)
- Who called the meeting
- And so forth

It also will need to analyse text to determine:
- Intent of statements
- Any discussion and resolutions
- Tabling, or voting down specific decisions
- Topical intent
- Any specific entity extraction that can be used with an active taxonomy (assume Wikidata as a taxonomy model)

The intent of this schema is to create a foundation for tracing decision making through an organisation.

Requirements:
- Use RDF-Star liberally to simplify structuring
- Assume both a timestamp, current relative time and xsd:dateTime indicator for tracking time
- This is a foundational schema, but can incorporate SHACL rules as necessary for computational purposes

Deliverables:
1. Generate the SHACL schema
2. Create a sample transcript showing a few different decision making and discussion scenarios
3. Using the derived SHACL schema, generate a corresponding RDF Turtle file holding that scenario as RDF in the associated schema

Context:
- User works primarily with W3C RDF stack - Turtle, SPARQL, SHACL
- User is a developer working typically in conjunction with either NodeJS or Python
- User is typically looking to develop conversion and parsing tools

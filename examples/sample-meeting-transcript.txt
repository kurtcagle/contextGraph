[10:02 AM] Sarah Johnson: Good morning everyone, thanks for joining. Let's get started. We have three main items on the agenda today: first, the proposed AI feature integration; second, the Q1 budget allocation; and third, timeline for the mobile app redesign. Let's start with the AI feature proposal. Michael, you're leading this one.

[10:03 AM] Michael Chen: Thanks Sarah. So, we've been evaluating several large language models for integration into our platform. Based on our analysis, I'm proposing we adopt Claude by Anthropic for our customer support automation. The API costs are reasonable, and the quality of responses is superior to alternatives we tested.

[10:04 AM] Jennifer Martinez: I have concerns about the infrastructure requirements. Do we have the capacity to handle the API load during peak hours? Our current architecture might need significant upgrades.

[10:05 AM] David Park: Jennifer raises a good point. I ran some projections using our current traffic data. At peak load, we're looking at approximately 500 API calls per minute. That's well within Anthropic's rate limits, but we'd need to implement proper caching and fallback mechanisms.

[10:06 AM] Sarah Johnson: What's the estimated cost impact, David?

[10:06 AM] David Park: Based on Claude's pricing, we're looking at roughly $8,000 per month initially, scaling to maybe $15,000 as adoption grows. That's about 30% less than our current human support costs for similar volume.

[10:07 AM] Lisa Anderson: From a UX perspective, I'd like us to ensure we're transparent with users about when they're interacting with AI versus human agents. We should follow ethical AI principles here.

[10:08 AM] Michael Chen: Absolutely agreed. I propose we implement a clear disclosure system and give users the option to escalate to human support at any time.

[10:09 AM] Sarah Johnson: Okay, let me propose this formally: We adopt Claude for customer support automation with the following conditions - implement proper disclosure, provide human escalation options, and Jennifer's team gets two weeks to assess and document infrastructure requirements before we proceed. Can we vote on this?

[10:09 AM] Michael Chen: I vote in favor.

[10:10 AM] Jennifer Martinez: I vote in favor, with the caveat that we delay launch if infrastructure concerns aren't resolved.

[10:10 AM] David Park: In favor.

[10:10 AM] Lisa Anderson: In favor.

[10:11 AM] Sarah Johnson: That's unanimous. Motion passes. Michael, you'll coordinate with Jennifer's team on the infrastructure assessment. Next item - Q1 budget allocation. We have $250,000 to allocate across three initiatives: the AI integration we just approved, the mobile redesign, and a new data analytics dashboard. David, you had a proposal for the analytics dashboard?

[10:12 AM] David Park: Yes. I'm requesting $80,000 for a comprehensive analytics dashboard that would integrate with our data warehouse. This would use tools like Apache Superset or Tableau for visualization. The dashboard would track key metrics including user engagement, conversion rates, and feature adoption.

[10:13 AM] Michael Chen: I think the analytics dashboard is important, but that's nearly a third of our budget. Could we start with a smaller proof-of-concept first?

[10:14 AM] David Park: We could, but we'd lose some of the integration benefits. A proof-of-concept would be maybe $30,000, but we'd likely need to rebuild significant portions when we scale up.

[10:15 AM] Jennifer Martinez: What if we phased it? Start with core metrics for $40,000, then expand based on actual usage and value demonstrated?

[10:15 AM] David Park: That could work. We'd focus initially on customer journey analytics and revenue attribution.

[10:16 AM] Sarah Johnson: I like the phased approach. Let's allocate $40,000 for phase one of the analytics dashboard. That leaves $210,000 for AI integration and mobile redesign. Michael, what's your budget need for the AI project?

[10:17 AM] Michael Chen: Including development, testing, and the first six months of API costs, we're looking at $90,000.

[10:17 AM] Sarah Johnson: That leaves $120,000 for mobile redesign. Lisa, is that sufficient?

[10:18 AM] Lisa Anderson: It's tight, but manageable. We'd planned for $150,000, so we'd need to cut some features or delay the iOS version to focus on Android first.

[10:19 AM] Michael Chen: Could we potentially table the analytics dashboard and allocate that budget to mobile? The dashboard, while useful, isn't customer-facing.

[10:20 AM] David Park: I disagree strongly. Without proper analytics, we're flying blind. We won't know if the AI integration or mobile redesign are actually successful. This is a strategic investment in decision-making capability.

[10:21 AM] Sarah Johnson: David makes a valid point about measurement. Let me propose an alternative - we approve the analytics dashboard at $40,000 and the AI integration at $90,000 as discussed. For mobile, we allocate $120,000 with the understanding that Lisa's team will prioritize features and potentially release in phases. Can we vote on this budget allocation?

[10:22 AM] Jennifer Martinez: Before we vote, I want to ensure we're holding back some contingency. These projects typically run over budget.

[10:22 AM] Sarah Johnson: Good point. Let's hold back $20,000 as contingency. So: $40,000 analytics, $85,000 AI integration, $105,000 mobile redesign, $20,000 contingency. Total: $250,000.

[10:23 AM] Michael Chen: I vote in favor of this allocation.

[10:23 AM] Jennifer Martinez: In favor.

[10:23 AM] David Park: In favor.

[10:24 AM] Lisa Anderson: I vote in favor, though I want it noted that the mobile timeline may slip as a result.

[10:24 AM] Sarah Johnson: Noted. Motion passes. Now, final agenda item - the mobile app redesign timeline. Lisa, walk us through your proposal.

[10:25 AM] Lisa Anderson: We're planning a complete overhaul of the mobile experience. Current users rate us 3.2 stars on average, primarily due to navigation issues and slow performance. The redesign addresses these concerns with a new information architecture and optimized code. We're targeting a 4.0+ star rating post-launch.

[10:26 AM] Lisa Anderson: With the $105,000 budget, I'm proposing a phased rollout. Phase 1 would be Android only, launching in April. Phase 2 would be iOS, launching in June. This gives us time to incorporate user feedback from Android before iOS release.

[10:27 AM] Jennifer Martinez: From an engineering perspective, the April timeline for Android is aggressive but doable if we start immediately. We'd need to allocate three developers full-time.

[10:28 AM] Michael Chen: What about beta testing? Are we factoring in time for that?

[10:28 AM] Lisa Anderson: Yes, we'd do a two-week beta with select users in March for Android.

[10:29 AM] David Park: Can we tie this to the analytics dashboard? I'd like to have proper tracking in place before we launch so we can measure impact accurately.

[10:29 AM] Sarah Johnson: That's a good point. Jennifer, can your team coordinate timing so analytics tracking is deployed before mobile launch?

[10:30 AM] Jennifer Martinez: Yes, we can prioritize the analytics infrastructure for March completion.

[10:31 AM] Sarah Johnson: Excellent. Any other concerns about the mobile timeline?

[10:32 AM] Michael Chen: Just one - should we consider holding this project until Q2 given our budget constraints? We're already stretching resources thin.

[10:33 AM] Lisa Anderson: I'd argue against that. Our mobile ratings are hurting app store visibility. Every month we delay costs us potential users. The negative reviews are starting to mention competitors by name, particularly Notion and Asana.

[10:34 AM] David Park: Lisa's right. I've been tracking app store sentiment, and we're losing ground. This is urgent.

[10:35 AM] Sarah Johnson: Okay, I'm not calling for a vote on this since we're not making a decision, just approving a timeline. Unless there are objections, we'll proceed with Lisa's phased approach - Android in April, iOS in June. Speak now if you object.

[10:36 AM] Michael Chen: No objection, but I want to schedule a checkpoint meeting in February to assess progress.

[10:36 AM] Sarah Johnson: Agreed. Jennifer, can you schedule that?

[10:37 AM] Jennifer Martinez: Will do.

[10:37 AM] Sarah Johnson: Alright, before we wrap up, let me summarize our decisions. First, we're adopting Claude for customer support with proper disclosure and human escalation. Second, budget is allocated as follows: $40,000 analytics, $85,000 AI integration, $105,000 mobile, $20,000 contingency. Third, mobile redesign proceeds with Android in April and iOS in June. Action items: Michael coordinates with Jennifer on AI infrastructure assessment, Jennifer schedules February checkpoint meeting, and David begins Phase 1 analytics dashboard planning. Anything else?

[10:38 AM] David Park: One quick item - I'd like to propose we standardize on Python for all data science work. Currently we have a mix of R and Python, and it's creating maintenance issues.

[10:39 AM] Sarah Johnson: That's a good point, but we're out of time today. Let's table that discussion for our next meeting. Add it to the agenda.

[10:39 AM] David Park: Will do.

[10:40 AM] Sarah Johnson: Thanks everyone. Meeting adjourned.

[Meeting ends: 10:40 AM]
